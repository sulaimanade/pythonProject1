print(phrase.lower()) #This is a function, this function renders the variable as lower case
print(phrase.upper()) #This is a function, this function renders the variable as UPPER case
print(phrase.isupper()) #This is a function, this function checks if the variable is in UPPER case
print(phrase.islower()) #This is a function, this function checks if the variable is in lower case
