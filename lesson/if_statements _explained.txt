The most common type of flow control statement is the if statement. An if
statement’s clause (that is, the block following the if statement) will execute if
the statement’s condition is True. The clause is skipped if the condition is False.
In plain English, an if statement could be read as, “If this condition is
true, execute the code in the clause.” In Python, an if statement consists of
the following:
• The if keyword
• A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False)
• A colon
• Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the if clause)

_______________________________________________________

if statements allow us to outline conditions
examples of conditions that can be represented in an if statement below:
illustration 1
I wake up
If I'm hungry
    I eat breakfast

illustration 2
I leave my house
If it's cloudy
    I bring an umbrella
otherwise
    I bring sunglasses

illustration 3
I'm at a restaurant
if I want meat
    I order a steak
otherwise if I want a pasta
    I order spaghetti and meatballs
otherwise I order salad

Note: In the real code, the "otherwise" word will be replaced with "else"

else Statements
An if clause can optionally be followed by an else statement. The else
clause is executed only when the if statement’s condition is False. In plain
English, an else statement could be read as, “If this condition is true, execute
this code. Or else, execute that code.” An else statement doesn’t have
a condition, and in code, an else statement always consists of the following:
• The else keyword
• A colon
• Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the else clause)

elif Statements
While only one of the if or else clauses will execute, you may have a case
where you want one of many possible clauses to execute. The elif statement
is an “else if” statement that always follows an if or another elif statement. It
provides another condition that is checked only if all of the previous conditions
were False. In code, an elif statement always consists of the following:
• The elif keyword
• A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False)
• A colon
• Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the elif clause)
